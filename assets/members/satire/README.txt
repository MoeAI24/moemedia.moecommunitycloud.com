SATIRE VAULT (v3)

1) Upload files here:
   /assets/members/satire/

2) Update this feed:
   /assets/data/satire-assets.json

Preview behavior:
- If you do NOT provide "preview", the vault will preview from "download" automatically.
So images WILL SHOW as soon as the download file exists.

Example:
{
  "title": "Moe News Not Even Worth Sh*t (Transparent)",
  "type": "png",
  "tags": ["satire","transparent","sticker","moe"],
  "date": "2026-01-31",
  "download": "/assets/members/satire/moe-news-not-worth-transparent.png"
}
