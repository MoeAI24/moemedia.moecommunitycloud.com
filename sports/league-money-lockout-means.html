          <article class="article-body">
            <p>When leagues talk about lockouts, coverage usually stops at games not being played. That’s the least important part. A lockout is a power negotiation disguised as a schedule problem — a conflict over revenue control, cost certainty, and leverage.</p>

            <h2>The economics beneath the headlines</h2>
            <p>Owners frame lockouts as financial necessity. Players frame them as fairness. Both narratives can be partially true, but neither explains why disputes flare at specific moments. Lockouts frequently appear around long-term transitions: new media deals, shifting sponsorship structures, expansion plans, or changes in revenue distribution models.</p>

            <h2>Leverage is the real product</h2>
            <p>Negotiations aren’t only about salary. They’re about who holds decision rights: how revenues are classified, which costs are deductible, how performance incentives are structured, and what share of growth goes to labor versus ownership. The language of “sustainability” often means predictability — protecting margins and reducing uncertainty.</p>

            <h2>Who absorbs the risk</h2>
            <p>Players risk irreplaceable time. Careers are short, and physical decline is real. Owners risk public goodwill and short-term operational disruption — but typically have more insulation. Fans are positioned as spectators, yet public frustration is often used as a pressure tool rather than treated as a stakeholder concern.</p>

            <h2>What to watch next</h2>
            <p>If you want to understand where a lockout is heading, follow the incentives: upcoming TV contract windows, changes in league-wide revenue assumptions, and how each side frames “fairness.” The story is rarely about one line item — it’s about the structure of the business.</p>
