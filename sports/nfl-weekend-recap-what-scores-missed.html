        <h1 style="margin:0 0 12px; font-size:32px; line-height:1.15;">NFL Weekend Recap: What the Scores Didn’t Tell You</h1>

        <p style="margin:0 0 14px; opacity:.92;">The final scores tell you who won. They don’t tell you why, how, or what actually changed. This weekend’s slate confirmed familiar truths about quarterback decision-making, coaching leverage, and how small mistakes compound late.</p>

        <h2 style="margin:22px 0 10px;">1) The quarterback gap is still the league’s fault line</h2>
        <p style="margin:0 0 12px; opacity:.92;">Across the league, the difference between stability and chaos came down to decisions under pressure. Some quarterbacks didn’t dominate statistically, but they protected possessions, kept the offense on schedule, and avoided the one mistake that flips field position and momentum.</p>

        <h2 style="margin:22px 0 10px;">2) Coaching decisions quietly swung outcomes</h2>
        <p style="margin:0 0 12px; opacity:.92;">The biggest momentum shifts weren’t always explosive plays. They were fourth-down choices, clock management, and red-zone sequencing. Some staffs coached to avoid blame. Others trusted preparation and accepted risk. That difference shows up in December.</p>

        <h2 style="margin:22px 0 10px;">3) Defensive fatigue is becoming the hidden story</h2>
        <p style="margin:0 0 12px; opacity:.92;">Several defenses cracked late not because of talent, but because of usage. Short offensive possessions, poor field position, and long drives compound. By the fourth quarter, even strong units lose discipline. Depth and rotation strategy matter more than most fans realize.</p>

        <h2 style="margin:22px 0 10px;">4) Media narratives are still one week behind reality</h2>
        <p style="margin:0 0 12px; opacity:.92;">One drive becomes a breakout. One bad quarter becomes a collapse. The tape usually tells a slower story: trends, not moments. Teams improving fundamentals rarely trend online — but they’re the ones that matter when the pressure becomes permanent.</p>

        <div class="notice" style="margin-top:18px;">
          <strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Infrastructure beats excitement. The teams that stayed organized under pressure — and adjusted without panic — were the real winners.
