        <h1 style="margin:0 0 12px; font-size:32px; line-height:1.15;">What This NFL Weekend Changed — and What Didn’t</h1>

        <p style="margin:0 0 14px; opacity:.92;">Every weekend produces reactions. Very few produce real change. This slate clarified which teams are building stability — and which teams are still chasing moments.</p>

        <h2 style="margin:22px 0 10px;">What changed</h2>
        <h3 style="margin:12px 0 6px;">1) Organizational patience is becoming a competitive advantage</h3>
        <p style="margin:0 0 12px; opacity:.92;">The most composed teams weren’t always the most talented. They were the most patient — with playcalling, adjustments, and player development. That restraint shows up late in games.</p>

        <h3 style="margin:12px 0 6px;">2) Young quarterbacks are being evaluated differently</h3>
        <p style="margin:0 0 12px; opacity:.92;">More teams are looking beyond the stat line. Command, pocket awareness, and situational decision-making are becoming the real indicators. That shift matters because development isn’t linear.</p>

        <h3 style="margin:12px 0 6px;">3) Defensive adjustments are catching up to offensive trends</h3>
        <p style="margin:0 0 12px; opacity:.92;">Early-season tendencies aren’t surprises anymore. Coordinators are adapting, forcing offenses to evolve. This is the point in the season where structure beats flash.</p>

        <h2 style="margin:22px 0 10px;">What didn’t change</h2>
        <h3 style="margin:12px 0 6px;">1) Talent still doesn’t fix structure</h3>
        <p style="margin:0 0 12px; opacity:.92;">Big names don’t compensate for poor communication, sloppy execution, or situational mistakes. Talent amplifies structure — it doesn’t replace it.</p>

        <h3 style="margin:12px 0 6px;">2) Narratives still chase moments, not patterns</h3>
        <p style="margin:0 0 12px; opacity:.92;">One drive becomes a breakout, one quarter becomes a collapse. Patterns matter more than moments, and the tape usually confirms what the standings hide.</p>

        <div class="notice" style="margin-top:18px;">
          <strong>Final thought:</strong> Teams don’t peak when they’re loud — they peak when they’re stable.
